# obfuscate
 Obfuscate your file names for privacy

 ## Usage
 Just run the program and follow instructions

 ## Examples
 ```
 IMG_64790832_02.JPG -> GPFA5JYM.jpg
 MyBirthday_2008.mp4 -> CT6LQSFG.mp4
 AllPasswords_01.doc -> S6P45UHJ.doc
 ```

 ## Remarks
 All files names in folder (subfolders) are obfuscated, but folder (subfolders) names are NOT obfuscated.
 All files extentions are converted to lowercase (force).
 There is a special option to save file names sorting order by fist letters.
 > [!WARNING]
 > Be careful! If you set the "Write changes" option (unchecked by default), the obfuscation of all file names in the specified directory will be performed immediately and there will be no way back -- it will be impossible to restore the previous file names (because the purpose of the program: obfuscation without the possibility to restore back)..
